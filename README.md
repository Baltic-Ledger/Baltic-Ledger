# Baltic Hedger: Automated Compliance & Risk Mitigation for Green H2

**Baltic Hedger** is a specialized compliance-as-a-service (CaaS) platform designed for the 2026 European energy market. We provide the digital infrastructure to bridge the Indo-Baltic hydrogen corridor, ensuring every kilogram of imported fuel is legally "Green" and financially optimized.

## 🇪🇪 Mission
To integrate with the **Hydrogen Valley Estonia (HVE)** ecosystem by providing a transparent, auditable data layer. Baltic Hedger eliminates "Greenwashing" risk for off-takers and "Tax Surprises" for producers entering the Baltic ports.

## Core Technology
* **RED III Compliance Engine:** Automated validation against the EU threshold of **28.2 gCO2e/MJ**.
* **Temporal Matching Logic:** Hourly correlation of renewable energy (PPA) vs. electrolyzer load.
* **CBAM Liability Forecast:** Live financial modeling of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism costs based on **Feb 2026 EU ETS** market pricing.
* **Well-to-Gate Traceability:** Generation of unique, immutable "Sustainability Passports."



##Regulatory Logic
Our system automates the 70% GHG reduction saving formula mandated by the EU:

$$Saving = \left(1 - \frac{E_{total}}{94.0}\right) \times 100\%$$

##  2026 Strategic Roadmap
* **Phase 1 (Current):** e-Residency Acquisition & Minimal Viable Product (MVP) testing.
* **Phase 2:** Integration with Estonian Smart Grid APIs (Tallinn/Muuga Port pilots).
* **Phase 3:** Operational relocation to Estonia via the **Startup Visa** program.
